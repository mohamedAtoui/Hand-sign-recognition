## Features

- Hand-sign recognition
- Classification of various hand signs
- Can be used for various applications

## Setup Instructions

To set up the hand-sign recognition model, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hand-sign-recognition.git
```

2. Navigate to the `model` directory:

```
cd Hand-sign-recognition/model
```

3. Follow the instructions in the `ReadMe.md` file to set up and train the model.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the hand-sign recognition model:

- To recognize hand signs in real-time, you can use a camera and a gesture recognition library to capture and classify hand signs.
- To recognize hand signs in pre-recorded videos, you can use a video processing library to extract frames and classify hand signs.
- To create a sign language recognition system, you can combine the hand-sign recognition model with a speech recognition library and a text-to-speech library.

## Notes

- The hand-sign recognition model is trained on a limited dataset, so it may not recognize all hand signs with high accuracy.
- You can improve the model's accuracy by collecting and labeling more hand sign data and retraining the model.
- The model is implemented in Python, so you need to have Python installed on your computer to use the model.
- You can use libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to implement the hand-sign recognition system.
